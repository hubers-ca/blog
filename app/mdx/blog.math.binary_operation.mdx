# Binary Operations and Where to Find them

## Introduction

In mathematics, operations are procedures we perform on numbers or variables. Examples you're familiar with include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. A **binary operation** is a special type of operation that combines two elements to produce another element.

## Understanding Binary Operations

Think of a binary operation as a machine that takes in two inputs and spits out one output. For example, consider addition, a common binary operation. If we input 2 and 3 into our 'addition machine', it combines these numbers and gives us 5 as output.

## Common Binary Operations

You encounter binary operations in mathematics more often than you might think:

- **Addition (+):** Combines two numbers to give a sum. Example: 2 + 3 = 5
- **Subtraction (-):** Finds the difference between two numbers. Example: 5 - 2 = 3
- **Multiplication (x):** Finds the product of two numbers. Example: 2 x 3 = 6
- **Division (/):** Divides one number by another. Example: 6 / 3 = 2

## Properties of Binary Operations

Binary operations can have certain properties:

- **Commutativity:** The order of the elements doesn't affect the result. For example, in addition, 3 + 2 = 2 + 3.
- **Associativity:** The way you group the elements doesn't affect the result. In multiplication, (2 x 3) x 4 = 2 x (3 x 4).
- **Identity element:** There is an element that, when combined with any other element, doesn't change the other element. For addition, this is 0, because 3 + 0 = 3.
- **Inverse element:** Every element has a counterpart that, when combined, yields the identity element. For multiplication, the inverse of 3 is 1/3, because 3 x 1/3 = 1.

## Importance of Binary Operations

Binary operations are fundamental in many areas of mathematics. They are the building blocks for many mathematical structures, including a special structure known as a 'group' which we'll explore in our next article. Stay tuned!
